Abstract
========

This paper addresses the well-known Max Cut problem, which has various applications both in machine learning and theoretical physics. The Max Cut problem is computationally intractable (NP hard) over general graphs. This paper presents a novel empirical approach aimed at enhancing the quality of Max-Cut approximations within polynomial time bounds. While the problem is tractable for graphs with small tree-width, its solution over general graphs often relies on Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) or Lovász-Schrijver relaxations. We achieve the described improvement of approximation quality by combining relaxation approaches, the tree-width ideas and various heuristics described in the paper.
